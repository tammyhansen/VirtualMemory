# VirtualMemory

/* Virtual Memory assignment
   Write my own methods to: 
   init()  initialize virtual memory,
   myMalloc()  allocate a memory block, and 
   myFree()  free memory.
   main() runs a few test cases and prints out
          the memory pool each time.
          Low bit 0 = free, 1 = allocated.
